1. A more efficient way to ask a user to fill the fields would be to code a function for each of the major fields (name, address, numbers) and return multiple values to the main function through the use of pointers.
2. An extra character is required to store C strings because they have a special property known as the terminator element or null terminator. This is one null byte (ALL 0's) at the end of the string.
