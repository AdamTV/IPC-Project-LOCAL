1. I beleive this assignment asked me to code a struct Contact holding other structs so I could effe
ciently store the contact information for 1 contact, and more if need be (with a little extra code).

2. The most difficult part of this assignment was initializing sturct Contact contact *facepalm* I
didn't realize I did it wrong and thought there was an error in my fuctions, little did I know I was
looking in the wrong file (contacts.c) until I saw there was no valid address for my variables but
wait I just sent you these variables oh wait no I didn't even declare them yet.

3. 2 hours maximum probably a lot less.
