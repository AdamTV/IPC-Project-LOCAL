1. A function is a modular section of code within a procedurally 
constructed program. A function consists of a header or a prototype
and a body or a definition. Good design principles for functions 
are that they perform a single task, and do not depend on too much 
information from other functions. Functions are required in any
programming language mainly for modularity & reusability.

2. As per their name, the helper functions are designed to help in
the process of retrieving the values for contacts. Their purpose is
to help retrieve information and that is why they are grouped to-
gether. They were not included in the contacts module because their
purpose is not to assign values to contact members, as is the 
purpose of the contacts module.
